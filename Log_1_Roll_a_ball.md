# Roll-a-ball

We completed the roll-a-ball guide and learned the basics of creating games in Unity.

In the development process there were some minor issues. These issues were mainly related to the choice of the IDE. We have solely used Rider as an IDE for C# up until this point, however working with Unity that proved difficult. 
Rider kept complaining about the scripts and in the end it was far more feasible to switch to Visual Studio.

Here are some screenshots of the game:
